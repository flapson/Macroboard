# MacroKeyboard

A Project to learn some Python and getting used to a RaspberryPi Pico.

At the Moment there are just 2 Buttons. The first one is to Mute/Unmute on a Teamspeakserver (Keys: F7 and F9 for the Hotkeys in Teamspeak)
and the second is for starting and joining ur selected Teamspeakserver on a Mac.
If you are muted,a Led is turned on and the Information is displayed on a LCD1602 with i2c.

Iam still learning, i think there is much to improve :D

If you want to use it aswell, you need to set ur Teamspeak Hotkeys to F7 and F9 for Headset and Microphone mute.
Same thing for connecting to your selected Teamspeakserver - I used F12 but u can set the Keys u want.
If u want to use other Keys,u need to change the Keys in the Code aswell.

2/6 Buttons used.

Im not sure about the TsConnect at Windows.Iam on a Mac.Probably u need to change the Code for that.
